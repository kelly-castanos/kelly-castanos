As a first-generation child born to Mexican parents, my background has enabled me to learn how to navigate through the challenges of the unknown. As well as to value the beauty of creating something meaningful from scratch; whether it be a life change or a website. My immersion into tech has my creative and free-spirited will waiting to break through.

My Skill Set:
- HTML5
- CSS 
- Javascript
- Node.JS
- MongoDB

Take a look at how I transfer my skills into live projects on my [website](https://kellycastanos.netlify.app/).
